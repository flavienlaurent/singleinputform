Single input form
===============

A single EditText instead of a classical form.

_Very inspired by the [Minimal Format Interface][1]._

I implemented an account creation form with only one EditText. The idea here is to pack a multiple (4 in the sample) input form in one field. As a result, the user input is easier and a more fluent process.

Also, I completely rediscovered [TextSwitcher][2] to animate the form: title, error message. It's very basic but simple to use.
